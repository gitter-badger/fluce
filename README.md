# Fluce

Well, Flux again ...

 - lib agnostic, but with helpers for React
 - forces to use immutable data structures in stores, or just never mutate
 - forces to use pure functions in stores
 - stores are just reducers of events to their state
 - server-side ready
 - without singleton global flux object
